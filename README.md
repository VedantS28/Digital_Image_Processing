# Digital Image Processing Practicals

This repository contains MATLAB / Python code examples and practical implementations for various concepts in Digital Image Processing.

## Repository Structure

Each practical is stored in its own folder.

## Included Practicals

1. **Reading and Displaying Image Components**  
   This practical demonstrates how to:
   - Read and display a color image.
   - Separate and visualize the Red, Green, and Blue components.
   - Convert the Red channel into grayscale.
   - Display a specific pixel's intensity value.

2. **Histogram Equalization Implementation for Grayscale Image**  
   This practical demonstrates how to:
   - Read and convert an image to grayscale
   - Calculate and visualize image histograms
   - Perform histogram equalization without built-in functions
   - Compare original and equalized images
   - Analyze intensity distributions using histograms and CDFs
   - Visualize the enhancement in image contrast

3. **Binary Representation and Bit Plane Slicing**  
   This practical demonstrates how to:
   - Convert a decimal number to its binary representation
   - Calculate the number of bits required to represent a given number
   - Extract and visualize individual bit planes from a grayscale image
   - Compare original and sliced images to understand the impact of each bit plane

## Prerequisites

  1. MATLAB installed on your system.
  2. Basic understanding of Digital Image Processing concepts.
